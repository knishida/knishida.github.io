### Kyosuke Nishida (西田 京介) 

I received my B.E., M.I.S., and Ph.D. degrees in information science and technology from Hokkaido University, Japan, in 2004, 2006, and 2008, respectively. I joined NTT Corporation in 2009 and is presently a [Distinguished Researcher](https://www.rd.ntt/e/organization/researcher/special/s_027.html) at [NTT Human Informatics Laboratories](https://www.rd.ntt/e/hil/). I also serve as a part-time lecturer at [Hosei University](https://www.hosei.ac.jp/english/). My current interests include natural language processing, vision-and-language, and artificial intelligence. I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IPSJ, the Association for Natural Language Processing (NLP), the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE), and DBSJ.
