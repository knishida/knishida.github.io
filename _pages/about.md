I received a B.E., M.I.S., and Ph.D. in information science and technology from Hokkaido University, Japan, in 2004, 2006, and 2008, respectively. I joined NTT Corporation in 2009 and am presently a [Distinguished Researcher](https://www.rd.ntt/e/organization/researcher/special/s_027.html) of [NTT Human Informatics Laboratories](https://www.rd.ntt/e/hil/). I also am a part-time lecturer in [Hosei University](https://www.hosei.ac.jp/english/). I received the Yamashita SIG Research Award from the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) in 2015 and the Kambayashi Young Researcher Award from the Database Society of Japan (DBSJ) in 2017. My current interests include natural language processing, vision-and-language, and artificial intelligence. I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IPSJ, the Association for Natural Language Processing (NLP), the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE), and DBSJ.
